# World Happiness Project
The goal of this project is to look at the "World Happiness Report" datasets available on Kaggle and compare them to different factors such as Poverty Rate, Education, and Religion. I want to see if there is any correlation between these datasets. For example: Do certain religious groups have higher happiness scores than others? Does poverty or wealth affect happiness? Are countries with more education opportunities happier than those with less? 

## Running the Program
To run this program, follow these steps:

* 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
* 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (instructions below).
* 3. Install the necessary dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'in the terminal.

You can now run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook.
When you are done exploring the repository, deactivate the virtual environment.

## Virtual Environment Instructions
*   After you have cloned the repository to your local machine, open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
    In VS Code, create a virtual environment via the terminal.
    Activate the virtual environment.
    Install the required packages.
    When you are done exploring the repository, deactivate the virtual environment.

## Virtual Environment Commands

| Command | Linux/Mac | GitBash |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Create | `python3 -m venv venv` | `python -m venv venv` |
| Activate | `source venv/bin/activate` | `source venv/Scripts/activate` |
| Install | `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br> or pip install packages | `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br> or pip install packages |
| Deactivate | `deactivate` | `deactivate` |

**In your project folder** 
- run python -m venv myenv (where myenv is the name of your virtual environment typically venv).

**Activate the Environment:**

- On Windows, use myenv/Scripts/activate.
- On macOS/Linux, use source myenv/bin/activate

**Install Packages:**

- Use pip install <package_name> to install packages that are needed for your project.

**Deactivate the Environment:**

- When you're done working, type deactivate to return to your global environment.

## Project Requirements 

To pass your project, ensure all the following criteria are met. Maintain regular communication with your mentors to stay aligned with these guidelines.

## Capstone Presentation and Interview

### Capstone Project Overview: 
Be prepared to explain your capstone project. Discuss the problem you aimed to solve and how your project addresses it.

### Code Functionality and Use: 
Demonstrate how your code supports your project’s functionality. Highlight a specific section of your code that you’re particularly proud of or found challenging to implement.

### Future Plans and Reflection: 
Reflect on your experience with Code:You. Share a key skill or lesson you’ve learned and how it will influence your future projects or career.

## GitHub Repository and Commits
Source control is a cornerstone of development, enabling version tracking, collaboration, and project management. GitHub provides developers with tools to track changes, collaborate, and present their work professionally. Requirements: Upload your project to a GitHub repository with at least 10 distinct commits. Use Git commands consistently to demonstrate ongoing progress, not just a final upload.

## README File
A README file serves as a roadmap for your project, providing essential details to ensure clarity and accessibility for collaborators and reviewers. Requirements: Write a detailed README file explaining your project in at least one paragraph. Identify and describe three or more features you integrated from the provided list. Include any special instructions for reviewers to run your project.

## Visual Appeal
In development, the user experience (UX) and visual design are just as critical as technical functionality. Your project should be engaging, visually cohesive, and aligned with industry standards. Requirements: Design your project to be visually appealing, following current industry trends. Ensure text is correctly spelled, legible, and consistent across all components. Use a clear and consistent design for headings, buttons, forms, and interactive elements. Research other applications and websites for inspiration. Emulate styles and functionalities that enhance usability and appeal. Choose a color palette and font stack to create a polished and professional design.

By meeting these standards, your project will demonstrate both technical proficiency and design sensibility, making it attractive to mentors, reviewers, and potential employers.
