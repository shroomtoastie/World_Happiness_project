    "\n",
    "My initial interest was sparked by the happiness dataset itself, as I was curious about what factors were used to measure \"happiness\". Beyond this initial curiousity, I began to think of other factors that could potentially correlate with this dataset and the happiness rating such as religion, education, and poverty/wealth. My goal is to analyze these different factors to show if they or how they may or may not correlate with the happiness datasets. "

    "* Plan to continue this project for some time, comparing the datasets that have been saved in the project venv environment folder and potentially finding more datasets in the future to add. I have been working with the happiness report datasets from 2021 and 2022. In the future, I hope to add more and create a more extensive timeline with statistical summaries that are up to date with 2025. I have successfully cleaned and merged the religion dataset with the happiness df for 2021-2022. Still figuring out and learining how I would like to present the information via Tableau. Beyond the religion dataset, I will continue with the education and poverty datasets. My plan is to continue working on this project daily, as it is all a learning process still. I also plan to notate my code accordingly, explaining my direction in this project and why I decided to do certain things, so whoever may view it can understand it easier. Another thing of note, is that I will also give credit in a resources tab of some sort. There are a few websites and forums that I have used to help me when I have ran into issues throughout. Last thing, I hope to shorten up my code extensively by using functions to call on and use repeatedly for example: a cleaning function. I have noticed that I have gone in circles sometimes and using a function could save me a lot of time and effort. I am not too confident in creating/using functions still, so I plan to study that aspect more with hopes to include it in this project at some point. "
