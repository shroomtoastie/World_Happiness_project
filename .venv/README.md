Project Requirements
To pass your project, ensure all the following criteria are met. Maintain regular communication with your mentors to stay aligned with these guidelines.

## Capstone Presentation and Interview
1. Capstone Project Overview:
Be prepared to explain your capstone project.
Discuss the problem you aimed to solve and how your project addresses it.
2. Code Functionality and Use:
Demonstrate how your code supports your project’s functionality.
Highlight a specific section of your code that you’re particularly proud of or found challenging to implement.
3. Future Plans and Reflection:
Reflect on your experience with Code:You.
Share a key skill or lesson you’ve learned and how it will influence your future projects or career.

## GitHub Repository and Commits
Source control is a cornerstone of development, enabling version tracking, collaboration, and project management. GitHub provides developers with tools to track changes, collaborate, and present their work professionally.
Requirements:
Upload your project to a GitHub repository with at least 10 distinct commits.
Use Git commands consistently to demonstrate ongoing progress, not just a final upload.

## README File
A README file serves as a roadmap for your project, providing essential details to ensure clarity and accessibility for collaborators and reviewers.
Requirements:
Write a detailed README file explaining your project in at least one paragraph.
Identify and describe three or more features you integrated from the provided list.
Include any special instructions for reviewers to run your project.

## Visual Appeal
In development, the user experience (UX) and visual design are just as critical as technical functionality. Your project should be engaging, visually cohesive, and aligned with industry standards.
Requirements:
Design your project to be visually appealing, following current industry trends.
Ensure text is correctly spelled, legible, and consistent across all components.
Use a clear and consistent design for headings, buttons, forms, and interactive elements.
Research other applications and websites for inspiration. Emulate styles and functionalities that enhance usability and appeal.
Choose a color palette and font stack to create a polished and professional design.

By meeting these standards, your project will demonstrate both technical proficiency and design sensibility, making it attractive to mentors, reviewers, and potential employers.
